# A Randomization Interface for Experimental Design and Analysis

## Definitions 
- Randomized Control Trials: All units of eligible impact in a trial are **randomly** assigned to different testing groups.
- Randomization Interface: Calculating regression p-values that consider randomized control trials data. 

## Code
- Simple implementation of the Fisherian randomization inference.
